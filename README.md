I have made an effort to structure the app in a way thats appropriate for a production app. I have made sure state is handled in a central location, as the project got larger the first thing to add would be redux.

# setup

1. npm i

# ios setup:

1. cd ios && pod install && cd ..

# run ios

1. npm run ios

# android setup:

1. create local.properties file in android folder which contains a reference to your android sdk e.g. 'sdk.dir = /Users/[User]/Library/Android/sdk

# run android

1. npm run android
